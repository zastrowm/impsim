# Usability Test Plans #

## Summary ##
The purpose of this document is to layout a test plan for testing the usability of the plugin system. During usability testing several tests will be performed as listed below and the results of each test will be recorded.
For each test the user will be asked to perform a task using the plugin, and a standard set of information will be recorded for each test as defined below. It is planned to test users who are familiar with imp, users who are familiar with at least one programming language, and users who may have some background modeling in other mechanical/physics programs.

## Information Recorded ##
For each test the following information will be recorded:
**How amiliar the user is with using a computer, programing languages, and using IMP or other physics/mechanics related software** Time taken to complete the task
**Number of errors committed, and details of the error** Number of times asked for help and what was asked
**Overall rating between 1-10 of how easy the task was** General Comments

## Tests ##
The following section describes the tests that will be performed. For each test the user will be asked to perform a specific task, but they will not be given instructions how to complete it initially. If the user gets stuck they can ask for help on how to complete the task. During each test the results will be recorded.

### Test 1 ###
