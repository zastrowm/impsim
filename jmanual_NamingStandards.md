## Naming Standards ##
  * Use descriptive names that give readers and idea of what the function is doing; Do not copy the function names from the C code.
  * Use camelCase for method and variable names.
  * Constants should be all UPPERCASE.
  * Add comments to Variables/ Fieldnames to identify them and what they do.

private static final CONSTANTVALUE = 100;

public double findDeterminant(Matrix a) {
    double retVal = 0;
     /* implementation here */
    return retVal;
}
