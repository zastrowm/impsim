_Figure 3-13:_ Example of a screw joint connecting two links.


The <tt>SCREW</tt> statement defines a screw joint connecting two links of the system (see figure 3-13).

===Format===
 <tt>SCREW</tt> (link name, link name) = joint name
where each _link name_ refers to the alphanumeric name given to one of the two connected links and _joint name_ is an arbitrarily chosen alphanumeric name assigned to the joint.

===Example===
 <tt>SCREW</tt> (BOLT, NUT) = THRD
defines a screw joint named _THRD_ connecting two links named _BOLT_ and _NUT_.

===Notes===
 # Each screw joint in the system must be defined by a separate <tt>SCREW</tt> statement.
 # No other joint of any type may be defined having the same _joint name_. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined joint of the same _joint name_ (and all information dependent on it); a message is printed.
 # The same _link name_ may appear in more than one statement defining a joint.
 # Each statement defining a joint must refer to two distinct _link names_. An attempt to join a link to itself causes the statement to be ignored and a message to be printed.
 # Two local coordinate systems must be chosen for each _joint name_ (see figure), and defined by a subsequent <tt>DATA SCREW</tt> statement. One local coordinate system (u,v,w) is rigidly attached to the first _link name_, while the other (u',v',w') is rigidly attached to the second _link name_. The local w and w' axes must be collinear and must be directed along the joint axis; both must have the same positive sense. The local u and u' axes must be chosen such that, at one position of the joint, they are collinear and the two local origins coincide (see figure).
 # If an appropriate <tt>DATA SCREW</tt> statement is not defined before an <tt>EXECUTE</tt> or <tt>EXECUTE HOLD</tt> statement is encountered, it is assumed that the corresponding local coordinate system(s) is (are) coincident with the link coordinate system; no message is printed.
 # The joint variable for a joint is the distance from the positive local u axis to the positive local u' axis. It has units of length and is considered positive when in the same direction as the positive local w,w' axes.
 # The order in which the two _link names_ appear is arbitrary. This choice, however, does affect the designation of the joint variable (see Note 7 above) and also the signs of the constraint force and torque components within the joint (see the <tt>PRINT FORCE</tt> statement).
 # It is assumed that there is no limit on the travel of the joint variable.
 # The lead of the screw thread of each <tt>SCREW</tt> joint must be defined by a subsequent <tt>DATA SCREW</tt> statement. Notice that the sign of the lead distinguishes a right-hand from a left-hand thread.




==The <tt>DATA SCREW</tt> Statement==
The <tt>DATA SCREW</tt> statement specifies the lead of a screw joint, the location of the joint, and the location of the two local coordinate systems.

===Format===
 DATA SCREW (joint name) = value; x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>,z<sub>1</sub>; x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>,z<sub>2</sub>; x<sub>3</sub>,y<sub>3</sub>,z<sub>3</sub>

where _joint name_ is the alphanumeric name of the <tt>SCREW</tt> joint, _value_ is the numeric
value of the lead of the <tt>SCREW</tt> joint thread, and the x,y,z coordinates define three points which are used to define the two local coordinate systems.

===Example===
 DATA SCREW (THRD) = -0.750; -1.0,1.0,0.0; -1.0,4.0,0.0; 0.0,1.0,-0.5

specifies the lead as 0.750 length units per revolution with a
left-hand thread and specifies the initial locations of the coordinate systems attached to the two links for a <tt>SCREW</tt> joint named <tt>THRD</tt>.

===Notes===
 # There must be a <tt>DATA SCREW</tt> statement for each joint defined by a <tt>SCREW</tt> statement. If these are not specified before an <tt>EXECUTE</tt> or <tt>EXECUTE HOLD</tt> statement is given, the simulation is halted and a message is printed.
 # The _joint name_ specified must have been defined by a previous <tt>SCREW</tt> statement. If not, the <tt>DATA SCREW</tt> statement is ignored and a message is printed.
 # If more than one <tt>DATA SCREW</tt> statement is given for the same _joint name_, the later statement takes precedence; earlier data are replaced and a message is printed.
 # The coordinate systems of the bodies are defined such that the distance and angle between the bodies are initially zero.
 # The dimensions of _value_ are length units of advance of the screw per revolution. A right-hand thread has a positive _value_ and a left-hand thread has a negative _value_.
 # The _value_ of the lead may not be zero. A <tt>REVOLUTE</tt> statement should be used instead of a <tt>SCREW</tt> for this case. If zero is specified for _value_, the <tt>DATA SCREW</tt> statement is ignored and a message is printed.
