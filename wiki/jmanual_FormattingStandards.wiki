#summary The formatting standards used in this project for java code.

== Formatting Standards ==
 * Whitespace (empty lines) should be used to break up code sections.
 * Keep starting curly bracket on the same line as the 'if' and 'else' statements.
 * The corresponding 'else' for a conditional should be on the same line as the closing curly bracket of the conditional, separated by a space.
 * User defined code folding is enabled through an Eclipse plugin.  The file is in the tools repository.  Simply put the file com.cb.eclipse.folding_1.0.6.jar in your Eclipse->Plugins folder.  After restarting Eclipse, go to Window->Preferences->Java->Editor->Folding and enable folding on user defined regions.

{{{
//[start] description of folded section
public String method(String param1, String param2) {
    String output = "";

    if (param1.equals(param2)) {
        output = "equal";
    } else {
        output = "not equal";
    }

    return output;
}
//[end]
}}}

Formatting can be done automatically via the IDE (see steps 6/7):
