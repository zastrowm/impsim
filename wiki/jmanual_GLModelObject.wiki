#summary Specification for the GLModel object.

= GLModel Object =
The GLModel.java class is an extension of AbstractGLObject and is intended to be our primary data structure for storing and displaying .OBJ models in the IMP graphics window. It has a single constructor with the following signature:

{{{
public GLModel(String name, Float[] vertices, Integer[] indexData, Mat4 initialRotation)
}}}

*name* is a unique identifier that is used by the graphics engine for display purposes.

*vertices* is the list of all points that will be drawn by the graphics engine. Each vertex is assumed to have four components in the format (x,y,z,w) and it is stored sequentially in that order. Each vertex is indexed by the start of every x value.

*indexData* is the list of indices to draw from.

*initialRotation* is the 4x4 rotation and translation matrix generated by the IMP core.


Once constructed, the user must make a call to the object's *initialize()* method within an OpenGL interface method call to bind the object to the GPU. Failure to do this will result in the program crashing with a segmentation fault. Afterwards, any changes to the object must be done through the object's *update()* method. 

Updating an object works as follows:
 # Arrange the new data into a List data structure
 # Within an OpenGL interface method call, call update passing in the list of data as well as an enumerated identifier of the type of data.
  * The types currently supported are: VERTEX_DATA, COLOR_DATA, ORIENTATION_DATA
 # The method will handle changes to the object and update the GPU memory accordingly
 # Repeat for all updates.


During rendering, the object is drawn by passing the 4x4 orientation matrix to the GPU as a parameter. The vertex shader is then in charge of performing the calculations on the vertices to determine correct locations.
