#summary Describes the naming standards for java code.

== Naming Standards ==
 * Use descriptive names that give readers and idea of what the function is doing; Do not copy the function names from the C code.
 * Use camelCase for method and variable names.
 * Constants should be all UPPERCASE.
 * Add comments to Variables/ Fieldnames to identify them and what they do

     /* implementation here */
