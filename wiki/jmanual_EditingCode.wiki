# Editing a class.

== Editing a class ==
 * If you edit a significant amount of similar items within a class, update the topmost comment block (before package and import declarations).
 * The @Edit will be the latest code change notes
 * Update version number after each code change

{{{
/*
* Point.java
* @version 1
* @author dykstran
* @edit zastrowm Removed setters since not all classes will allow setters
* @review username 1
*/
}}}

== Editing a method ==
 * If you edit a single method or algorithm, update that method's comment.

{{{
/**
* This method does some stuff.
* @param x The thing to do stuff to.
* @return The thing to which stuff was done.
* 
* @author dykstran
* @edit zastrowm Changed the way stuff was done.
