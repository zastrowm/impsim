
The purpose of this chapter is to present examples of simulations performed on the IMP system, thereby demonstrating the use of the IMP language and showing the form of the output.

Many of the pages of this chapter are direct reproductions of IMP output. Some symbols have been added in the right-hand margins, however, which refer to notes of explanation on subsequent pages. Careful attention should also be paid to the figures accompanying each example since these show the alphanumeric names used for links, joints, etc. 

The examples chosen are merely illustrative and, for lack of space, are not intended to be exhaustive. Not all details of each example are explained, and the reader should consult the previous chapters as questions arise. These examples do show, however, how many of the IMP statements interrelate, and illustrate some of the more useful features of the IMP system. 

==A Differential Control Linkage==
The first example presented is the two degree of freedom differential control linkage shown in the figure on the next page. In this device, the sliding joint JT1 and the pin joint JT8 are both driven externally, and the output of the linkage is the rotation of the pin joint JT5. The purpose of the analysis is to verify the geometric relationship between the output position of JT5 and the input JT8, while holding JT1 fixed at various settings.

The next several pages show portions of the printed IMP output. The IMP language statements typed by the user are printed exactly as submitted to the IMP interpreter.

===Notes===
# The response specifies that the user is currently operating with a graphic display terminal and expects to be drawing plots of results.
# Data is to be read from a data file and printed at the terminal as it is read.
# The <tt>RECALL INPUT</tt> statement initiates the request to read command input from a file. Since no filename is given in the statement, the IMP system prompts the user for the filename.
# The <tt>GROUND</tt> statement would not have been required if the name <tt>BASE</tt> had been chosen for the fixed link.
# Note that only one point is specified in each of these <tt>DATA ZPIN</tt> statements; the global origin is implied for the location of the missing second and third points.
# Note that this data is described relative to the local joint coordinate systems. It places the point <tt>END</tt>, for example, at the left end of link <tt>D</tt>.
# Although the figures in this manual do not show in color, these <tt>SHOW</tt> statements specify colors for display on color capable terminals. If the device is not color capable, the <tt>SHOW</tt> statements may still be used in the input data file without causing errors.
# The <tt>PAUSE ON</tt> statement is used to cause pauses and messages in the output which read "Press <tt>ENTER</tt> to continue: &gt;", thus allowing the user to study results before they are lost from the screen.
# Note that, if this statement were not included, IMP would arbitrarily choose some joint to hold stationary since the system has two degrees of freedom and the simulation is in kinematic mode.
# The simulation is requested to proceed through six positions; the position of joint <tt>JT8</tt> is incremented five times.
# Note the use of the <tt>DATA TIME</tt> statement in kinematic mode. This feature allows use of functions of time in kinematic mode. The <tt>DATA TIME</tt> statement was not necessary here and would have been implied by the five position increments of the previous line; it is used to illustrate the procedure.
# The <tt>RETURN</tt> statement is read from the command input file and causes control to return to the terminal. The user then manually enters the <tt>EXECUTE</tt> command.
# After the simulation is completed, the user may continue the problem, modifying the model and analysing again.
# Here, since no filename is given, IMP continues reading statements from the same <tt>DIFLNK.DAT</tt> command input file used earlier until the next <tt>RETURN</tt> statement is encountered.
# These warning messages are not part of the user's input statements; they are given by the IMP system as reminders to the user when previous data are redefined. The <tt>ANIMATE</tt> statement causes an animated drawing sequence,
# not immediately, but after the next <tt>EXECUTE</tt> statement. Since the input position data are not respecified for <tt>JT8</tt>, the time increments and final time values from the last execution are used again.
# Since there is no intervening <tt>DRAW</tt> command, the <tt>ANIMATE</tt> command is still active for this execution.
# When <tt>RECALL INPUT</tt> is attempted with no further data in the file, an error message is printed and control is returned to the user's terminal.
# The analysis of this system is terminated here and the IMP program is exited. Another analysis could have been initiated without exiting the IMP program by use of the <tt>CLEAR</tt> statement.

==A Front End Loader==
The second example is the lift mechanism of a front end loader, with hydraulic coupling of the actuators simulated in the model. A drawing of the linkage is shown in the figure on the next page. The objective here is to design the loader to achieve maximum height while maintaining the horizontal position of the bucket. 

The first portion of the simulation demonstrates the kinematic performance of the loader and also illustrates some of the graphic capabilities of IMP. The second portion examines the forces at particular joints during the lift operation with a load applied in the bucket. IMP's plotting capabilities are demonstrated here.

===Notes:===
# Note that this is actually a 2-D kinematic model of the loader. Only one set of links and joints are defined along the central plane of the model (Z = 0). 
# In spite of note (1) above, the picture is made to appear 3- D by defining two sets of points, one at Z = 40 and the other at Z = -40
# Two of the points used to define the shape definition of the bucket for DRAW purposes are also used here to determine the angle of the bottom of the bucket with respect to ground. 
# The result of this VALUE statement is that the variable V at all times has a value which is three tenths of the value of the rotation of joint J
# This statement causes the motion of the sliding joint J6 to be set by the value of the variable V, thus defining the hydraulic coupling between the actuators. The motion of J6 now becomes an SGC in the simulation. 
# Because of the EXECUTE HOLD statement this message is a warning to the user that the geometry has not returned to its starting position. 
# This RESET statement is required because of the previous EXECUTE HOLD. Without this RESET the value of time is not reset to zero for the beginning of the next EXECUTE. 
# A new DATA POSITION statement is issued to fix the position of joint J4 at its current position; if this were not done, IMP would use the earlier data which determined the lift motion. 
# This statement removes the dependence of the motion of joint J6 on the value of the variable V. 1
# Here, the hydraulic coupling is reestablished in the model. 1
# Note that mass units are consistent with the use of pounds, inches, and seconds. See UNIT(MASS) statement for details. 1
# The outputs requested are plots of the values of forces in specified joints of the model. In this simulation, these forces depend only on how the weight in the bucket is transmitted through the joints and links of the model and adds to weights of the other links.

==An Industrial Sewing Machine==
The third example presented is a drive train for the thread looper in an industrial sewing machine. It is illustrated in the figure on the next page. The main crankshaft is driven by an electric motor at a speed of 8000 rpm. The purpose of the simulation is twofold: First, the designer is interested in the path of the tip of the thread looper since it must not interfere with the needle. Secondly, because of the high speed, there is concern about the dynamic bearing reactions throughout the cycle of operation. 

The first of these two problems, being strictly geometric, is solved in kinematic mode. The second problem can also be solved in kinematic mode if it is assumed that the motor speed is constant under the variable dynamic load. This very reasonable assumption results in considerable saving over use of the dynamic mode. 1. Courtesy of Union Special Machine Company, Chicago, Illinois.

===Notes:===
# A carriage return was given for this question, thus accepting the default response which is "graphic". Though most output is printed lists, the "graphic" response is still neccessary to see plots. 
# The GROUND statement is not necessary since the name BASE is chosen for the fixed link. 
# Notice that the fork engaging the stud on the ball at the upper end of the connecting rod prevents rotation about the axis of the connecting rod. Thus, although this joint resembles a spheric joint, it is, in effect, equivalent to a universal joint. 
# The joint at the forked end of the link LEVR is not of a type available in the IMP language. Therefore, it is remodelled as coincident ZSLIDE and SPHERE joints. The ZSLIDE joint allows sliding within the fork while the SPHERE joint allows complete freedom for rotation. Although the true fork is not able to rotate about one axis (along the link LEVR), this is prevented in the present model by the joints CAM and PIN. 
# The curved slot in this barrel cam is a true helix. Thus, this joint is equivalent to a long lead screw. 
# The products of inertia are interpreted as zero since they are not given explicitly. 
# Note how the order in which the links are named in the joint definition statements determines which force is listed and plotted, the action or the reaction.

==A Left-Front Automotive Suspension==
The fourth example presented is the left-front suspension system of a standard, midsize, passenger car. It was simulated as a part of a study done by the Vehicle Modeling Task Force of the Fatigue Design and Evaluation Committee of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).

The suspension system modeled is shown in the figure on the next page. It can be noted that the vehicle frame is assumed stationary and that the steering arm is fixed to the frame. Thus, there is only one predominant motion possible, the jounce of the wheel.

In the first simulation presented, the equilibrium position is sought, while the geometry, and the forces in all joints are printed. This is followed by a second simulation in which the bottom of the tire is subjected to a deep hole at a speed corresponding to the first resonant frequency, the "wheel hop" frequency. VALUE statements are used to simulate the separation of the tire from the road, to allow impact with the jounce and rebound bumpers, and to change the shock absorber damping rates for extension and compression. Partial listings are presented of the dynamic mode simulation results. These were compared and correlated well with experimental results gathered by tests made for the committee under the same conditions by a major US auto company.

===Notes:===
# Since link BODY is treated as stationary, provision must be made to allow the ROAD to move. The relative motion between these is controlled to correspond to the road profile, the bump shape passed over by the tire. 
# Note that the BUMP joint is located colinear with the global Z axis. Since the ROAD link is completely rigid, the actual location of the BUMP axis is unimportant as long as its orientation is vertical. 
# The upper and lower control arm pivots, UPIN and LPIN, could be modeled as cylindric joints with axial motion constraints, perhaps stiff springs. Here they are modeled as revolute joints. 
# The actual ball joint at the spindle end of the tie rod is modeled as a universal joint; this eliminates the freedom of the tie rod to spin about its own axis. 
# The flexibility of the tire and its freedom to roll on the road surface must be modeled in terms of fictitious links connected by joint types acceptable to IMP. Even though roll, castor, and camber angular movements may be small, joint freedoms must be provided for them. 
# VALUE statements are used to represent the stiffness and damping of the tire in compression, with none in tension. This is very important when the tire leaves the road surface since the stiffness would go into tension. 
# Note the use of global coordinate data rather than local data to locate certain points. Either is acceptable; the choice depends on the convenience of the user. 
# A typical automotive shock absorber has different damping rates in tension and compression. This is modeled here by the use of VALUE statements. 
# The jounce and rebound bumpers (not shown in the figure) are modeled as springs and dampers connecting the impact points. The stiffness and damping rates are set to zero when not in contact. 1
# The first simulation is an equilibrium search with the road height held constant. 1
# The default position tolerance is tightened here to allow a more accurate determination of the forces involved in the static equilibrium search. 1
# The simulation is ended with the model remaining in the equilibrium position. 1
# Time is reset to zero after the previous EXECUTE HOLD statement. This was not necessary since time did not change in the equilibrium search. It is a good practice, however, and is often required (see the earlier Front-End Loader example.) 1
# VALUE statements are used here to describe a single-cycle haversine hole as the road profile. 1
# Listings and plots of the requested positions and forces follow the simulation. The first column of each listing gives values of time; the next six columns represent the X,Y,Z components of the constraint force and torque, respectively. 
==A Double Toggle Bench Clamp==
The next example is the simulation of a double toggle bench clamp. This clamp could be used in many places in a manufacturing environment. The purpose of the clamp is to keep the clamping pad forced against a vertical surface holding an object in place while work is performed.

===Notes:===
# Here the LINK statement defines the existence of a link and the SOLID READ statement refers to a file which contains a solid geometric model of the shape of that link; the two are related by use of the SHAPE statement. In the first use here, the link named BASE becomes defined and its SOLID shape definition comes from a file named BARAD.geo in the users file area. See notes on the SHAPE statement in Chapter 3 and the file format definition in Appendix A for further details. 
# If a solid geometric model of the link shape has been supplied (see note 1 above), then the DATA DENSITY statement can be used to cause automatic calculation of the mass, the center of mass, and the mass moments and products of inertia for that link. If this is done, then DATA MASS and DATA INERTIA statements need not be given. Note that the link and its shape must have been defined before the DATA DENSITY statement is given. 
# When the solid model has been read from a file (see note 1 above) it is initially positioned at the associated link coordinate system location by the SHAPE statement. The link, including its solid shape, may then be moved to a new position and orientation by using the LINK option in the DATA LINK statement. This link may be moved to a new location either before or after other points or joints are connected to it; however, the form of the data for these connected items may be different depending on the order in which the steps are taken. See the DATA LINK statement of Chapter 4 for details. 
# This force represents the resistance applied to the clamping pad, against which the clamp must be caused to close. Notice that the points F0, F1, and F2 were defined by previous POINT statements; points from the part shape file could not be used since they have no names by which to reference them. 
# The DATA VIEW statement can be used to choose a viewing direction and to scale the picture to fit the screen.
