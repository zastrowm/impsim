#summary The guidelines used when creating a wiki page.

= Wiki Guidelines =
Verify the following when creating a new wiki page:
 * At the top of the page there is an introduction to the concepts introduced, and then the table of contents (like wikipedia).
 * Formatted correctly (bulleted lists are bulleted corrected, numbered lists as well).
 * Code segments follow new Strict IMP guidelines.
  * The syntax should be updated to match strict IMP.
  * Nothing is implied... there can be no missing values. Many DATA statements use implied values in extra examples.
 * Figure captions are directly below the images.
 * Text has been proofread for grammar errors.
 * Text had been proofread to verify that it uses the new language ideas rather than the old language (i.e. it doesn't reference examples using implicit values).
