== Allow user to view any aspect of the model ==

=== Model Orientation ===
A user wants to see a different side of the model.

1. The user rotates the view XYZ(30, 60, 90).
2. The view is redrawn according the to adjustment specified by the user.

=== Model Motion ===
A user wants to slowly rotate the model.

1. The user specifies an orientation XYZ(30, 60, 90) and a speed.
2. The view is moved to the given orientation and set in motion at the speed given with the direction determined from the new orientation's difference from the old orientation. Think of it as a kind of mouse throw gesture.

=== Model Zoom ===
A user wants to see more detail about a certain joint.

1. User moves the view closer to the joint.
2. The view is redrawn larger with clipping at the edge of the view.

=== Model Layers ===
A user wants to see joints that are obscured by other parts of the model.

1. The user deselects which layers are visible.
2. The model is redrawn with out those layers showing.


== Track the data generated by the model ==

=== Track Variables ===
A user wants to know how certain parts of the model are performing.

1. User selects a joint (or joints) and specifies which variables are of interest.
2. These variables are plotted versus time.

=== Visualize Variables ===
A user wants to see certain variables displayed on the model itself.

1. User selects a joint and specifies a variable of interest. 
2. The User selects a color range to use for the variable.
2. As the variable changes, the plot data will change colors specified by the color range as it moves along the plot.

== Viewing imported models ==

=== Drawing Imported Models === 
A user is viewing a model imported from another external program eg. CAD

1. The User has the model imported into imp and has the Graphics window showing
2. The model shall be shown as it was drawn in the external program with any textures applied to it.

== Definitions ==
 * Orientation given as an absolute position "XYZ(x, y, z)" looking towards the origin at (0, 0, 0).
