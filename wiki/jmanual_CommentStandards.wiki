= Regular Comments =

== All functions ==
 * Any function having more than 5 lines should probably have a comment  in it somewhere.
 * Add comments to denote sections in the code (eg. Error checking, variable initalization, traversing a datastructure, etc.) (ie. Anywhere there is a block of 3 or more lines of code that are closely related.)
 * Don't add unnecessary comments that clutter the code, keep comments concise
 * Comments should explain WHY certain things are done, not just WHAT is done

== Variables ==
 * Label all class variables with comments telling what each variable is used for.
 * For any package scope variables specify that this is intentional with /* package */ in front e.g. 
{{{ 
/* package */ int randomValue;
