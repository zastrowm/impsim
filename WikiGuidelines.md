# Wiki Guidelines #
Verify the following when creating a new wiki page:
  * At the top of the page there is an introduction to the concepts introduced, and then the table of contents (like wikipedia).
  * Formatted correctly (bulleted lists are bulleted corrected, numbered lists as well).
  * Code segments follow new Strict IMP guidelines.
    * The syntax should be updated to match strict IMP.
    * Nothing is implied... there can be no missing values. Many DATA statements use implied values in extra examples.
  * Figure captions are directly below the images.
  * Text has been proofread for grammar errors.
  * Text had been proofread to verify that it uses the new language ideas rather than the old language (i.e. it doesn't reference examples using implicit values).
